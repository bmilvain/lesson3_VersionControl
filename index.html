            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control or source control is a software application that manages changes to files, documents, programs, web sites and other assembled pieces of information. Some simplistic version control systems or Local Version Control Systems, just copy files into another directory sometimes with a time-stamp. Unfortunately, this allows for errors. Some of these errors might include, you may forget what directory you put this file in, copy files over it, or god forbid change something simultaneously as some one else. Thus both alterations are not tracked so you may miss the big break through in your project.</p>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control is a little more advanced, in that it allows multiple users (developers) to have access to the same server. The developer will “check out” files. This way everyone basically knows what everyone else is doing. Some disadvantages to this type is that if your server goes down, then so does the project. Or if the hard disk to the server is corrupt then you may lose the entire project because proper backups have not been kept.</p>
            <p class="lead">This brings us to the Distributed Version Control System, this is the most advanced Version Control application. This application not only tracks the changes that you make, but also saves a version for you, that enables you to revert back to the version you used before your latest, or second to the latest or third, etc. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), also shows you who made the changes and when.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With several Version Control Systems out there, one of the easiest and most powerful is Git. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel. Git is a free and open source (DVCS) Distributed Version Control System, that tracks changes in computer files, programs even source code. Being a Distributed Version Control System, it allows every developer’s working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.</p>
            <p class="lead">Git is unique in how it thinks about data. Git treats its data like a series of snapshots. So every time you save a file or commit, Git takes a snapshot or picture of the files at the precise moment and time stamps it. To speed things up, if you don’t change a section, that portion does not get involved in the snapshot, it just saves a link to the old picture to pickup later if a change occurs. Comparing past versions, merging, branching and committing new changes are all optimized for performance. Git focuses on the file content itself, instead of following names of files when determining what the storage and version history should be.</p>
            <p class="lead">All of the objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. Which is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters. Using this algorithm protects the code and the change history against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One way that demonstrates the ease of learning Git, is the commands it uses. Using either Terminal for the Mac or Command Prompt for the PC, the commands used in Git are very straightforward. Some of the basic commands are: git commit, git branch, git checkout and git checkout –b.</p>
            <p class="lead">Git Commit - adds the latest changes to (part of) the source code to the repository. It permanently records or takes a snapshot of the files as they existed at a given time. These changes to the file can now be seen by any developer on the “team”.</p>
            <p class="lead">Git Branch - means you deviate from the main line of development and continue work without messing with that main line. You are basically working in Parallel with the main line. This allows you to experiment on a different idea without effecting the original code. If the experiment does not wok, you can delete that branch and the main line is still intact.</p>
            <p class="lead">Git Checkout – switches from the master to another commit. Git checkout can be used to view old commits. Like let’s go checkout this file.</p>
            <p class="lead">Git Checkout –b <branchname> – simultaneously creates a new branch then switches you to that new file.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Creating a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Git program was developed to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time and to track these changes and updates. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. A Git repository contains a set of commit objects and a set of references to commit objects, called heads. A commit object contains three things: 1) a set of files, showing the state of the project at a given time. 2) references to parent commit objects and 3) An SHA1 name, a 40-character string the exclusively identifies the commit object.</p>  
            <p class="lead">You obtain a repository in two different ways, the first way is to take a local directory, that is not under version control and turn it into a Git repository or the second way that you can obtain a repository is to clone an existing repository from somewhere. To create a repository, create a directory for the project if it doesn’t exist, enter it, and run the command git init. This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files—a Git repository skeleton.</p>
            <p class="lead">Your new repository will be the central repository for your files, which means that others can access that repository if you give them permission. Each repository has a 2 GB size limit, but rarely are they that large.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub (originally known as Logical Awesome LLC) is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects. Git Hub was started in 2008 and now claims to have, as of April 2017, almost 20 million users and 57 million repositories.</p>
            <p class="lead">Once you have established your account on GitHub, you are able to connect with Git repositories using the HTTPS:// protocol. GitHub is free but on the condition that all of your projects are fully public. You can customize your account with avatars and two-factor authentication to increase security of your account being compromised.</p>
            <p class="lead">With GitHub, you can contribute to a project since all projects are public, allows you to “fork” a project, that is you can access a project, even if you do not have push access, and you can show your changes or updates to the project to the owner and they can decide to use it or not.</p> 
            <p class="lead">I think GitHub, is an amazing resource for the web developer. I love the mascot. GitHub has a mascot called Octocat, a cat with five tentacles and a human-like face.</p>
