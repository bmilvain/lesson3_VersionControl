## Project Description:
I actually thought this assignment was very difficult. For one I found it hard to come up with 5 concepts that I learned when most of the information given was about Git. It also was long. I know that on this assignment I spent more than 6 hours on it. I have a full time job and this is taking up more time than my previous two classes.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I found the concept of Version Control and what it does pretty facinating. I can see where it would be extremely valuable to track the changes and who made them but also be able to go back to different branches if one did not work out.
2. I thought the lesson on git commands was very helpful. The fact that you could type the command and immediately see the result was great.
3. I thought one of the best lessons was the GitHub lesson. I thought it was very informative and like the command lesson, it showed you what the commands you typed, actually did.
